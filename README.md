# Dsp Course
This is an introductory DSP(Digital Signal Processing) course written by Patrik Lechner for a course('EPRO') that was held for many years at the University of Applied Sciences Sankt PÃ¶lten. 

This course was originally taught using Pure Data and is now taught in Max/MSP. Therefore this **branch using pd will no longer be updated**. 

Find an up to date version of this course using max/MSP on the [master branch](https://github.com/hrtlacek/dspCourse/tree/master) of this repository. 

## Usage
Open the [main.pdf](main.pdf). 
The course is written in LaTex, the examples are made in pure Data and python. Feel free to contribute.
