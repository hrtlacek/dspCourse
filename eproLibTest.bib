	abstract = {"This book investigates digital signal processing, its application to sound, and how its effects on sound can be used within music. The first edition developed in association with the annual International Conference on Digital Audio Effects, and this book have been critical in the advancement of the field, both in research and industry. Rapid development in different fields of Digital Audio Effects has led to new algorithms, and this new edition will combine these with improved presentation of the basic concepts and discussion of the related technology. It will cover filters and delays, modulators and demodulators, nonlinear processing, spatial effects, time-segment processing, time-frequency processing, source-filter processing, spectral processing, time and frequency warping musical signals, as well as completely new chapters on the recent developments in virtual analog effects, automatic mixing, and sound source separation. Each effect description will begin with a presentation of the physical and acoustical phenomena, followed by an explanation of the signal processing techniques to achieve the effect, and some musical applications and the control of effect parameters"--},
